# fqlite

FQLite is a tool to find and restore deleted records in sqlite databases. It is written with the Java programming language. The program can operate in two different modes. It can be started from the command line (CLI mode). A simple graphical user interface is also supported (GUI mode).  

The program is able to search a SQLite database file for regular as well as deleted records.

# Example Usage

To run the *FQLite* in CLI mode the executable jar can normally be started with a double-click on the jar-archive file. If this does not work, since *javaw* is not linked correctly to files of ending *.jar*, you can use the command line as well:

$>java -jar fqlite.jar 



$>java -cp fqlite.jar fqlite.hsmw.de.RT <database.db>
