# FQLite - Forensic SQLite Data Recovery Tool

FQLite is a tool to find and restore deleted records in sqlite databases. It therefore examines the database for entries marked as deleted. Those entries can be recovered and displayed. It is written with the Java programming language. The program can operate in two different modes. It can be started from the command line (CLI mode). A simple graphical user interface is also supported (GUI mode).  

The program is able to search a SQLite database file for regular as well as deleted records.

# Prerequisites

To run the tool you need at least a Java Runtime Environment 1.8 or higher.


# Example Usage

To run the FQLite in GUI mode the executable jar can normally be started with a double-click on the jar-archive file. If this does not work, since javaw is not linked correctly to .jar files, you can use the command line as well:

$ java -jar fqlite<version>.jar


To run the FQLite from the command line you can use the following command:

$ java -jar fqlite<version>.jar nogui <database.db>

Here is a more complex example with parameters:

$ java -jar fqlite<version>.jar nogui --threads:4 --loglevel:ERROR <database.db>

   nogui                     ->    start program in command line mode
--threads:4                ->    use 4 threads to analyze the data records
--loglevel:ERROR   ->    print only ERROR messages to standard output
